    <h1>Irish Cream Sugar Cookies</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are deliciously soft moist sugar cookies with the creamy richness of Bailey's Irish Cream! Wonderful as a St. Patrick's day treat or for any day you're craving a sugar cookie. I brought these to a party and within minutes, they disappeared. Feel free to omit the Bailey's and just cut down the flour by about half a cup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ cup Irish cream liqueur</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream together butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in vanilla and egg yolk until combined, then beat in egg; beat until smooth. Pour in Irish cream, and beat until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Sift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir into butter mixture until evenly mixed. Form into a flattened ball, wrap well with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper</li>
            <li>Roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness on a floured work surface. Cut into shapes using cookie cutters and place onto prepared baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown around the edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool on a wire rack until they reach room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
